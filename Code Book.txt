The variables of the new tidy data set in "new_data.txt"

Subject: the subject performing the activity. Range is from 1 to 30.
Activity: six different activities coded as: 1 WALKING; 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS; 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS; 4 SITTING; 5 STANDING; 6 LAYING

The following are 66 different measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals. 
Time domain signals is prefixed with 't.' 
Frequency domain signals is prefixed with 'f."
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals such as tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were separated into Jerk signals such as tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ. 
The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals are denoted such as tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag.
